# Website Building Instructions

## Introduction

I used [Material for MkDocs](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) to render `Markdown files` into `HTML web pages` and published them using `GitHub Pages` [Material for MkDocs Documentation](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)


## Repository

The markdown source files for this website are stored at [github.io](https://Charleyhoo.github.io/Charleyhoo.github.io/)

If you would like to provide any suggestions, you can:

- Submit an issue in the [Issues](https://Charleyhoo.github.io/Charleyhoo.github.io/issues) section
- Create a pull request in [Pull Requests](https://Charleyhoo.github.io/Charleyhoo.github.io/pulls) the source file in the section. To make changes to an article, click on the edit button located on the right-hand side of the article title.
