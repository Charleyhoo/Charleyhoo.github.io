Share my personal experience of some TV shows which I'm interested in.

## House of Cards - lines sharing

1. I feel like an idiot leaving messages .
2. Rubbing shoulders with the big boys.
3. I don’t have time to be anyone’s training wheels.
4. Not when is big.
5. I’m livid. Throw a temper?
6. A person’s character isn’t determined by how he or she enjoys vitory, but rather how he or she endures defeat. Nothing can help us endure dark times better than our faith.
7. Lean not on our own understanding.
8. Has the seed been planted? He has a choice. Will he wither or will he thrive? Only time will tell.
9. Only total victory will put me back in his good grace. The alternative is exile, which would mean the last five months were for nothing. I cannot abide falling back to square one.([Gridplay](Gridplay.md#House%20of%20card))
10. The party’s investing in you, I need to make sure you’re investing in yourself.
11. For a moment, the moment last the length of a breath.
12. As we used to say in Gaffney, never slap a man  while he’s chewing tobacco.
13. You know, I thought I would miss this place the moment I stepped inside. But I don’t
14. Walker doesn’t flinch at the lack of respect it implies.
15. The higher up the mountain, the more treacherous the path.
16. I’ve seen my mom more in the past month than I left for school.
17. I’ve always loathed the necessity of sleep. Like death, it puts even the most powerful men on their backs.
